Building a fully automated Viking Face Swap & Scenario Generator integrated with your Shopify website involves several key components: AI face-swapping technology, a seamless user experience, automation, and email delivery. Below is a rough outline of how to approach building this system, including some technical tools, frameworks, and AI models that could be useful.
Key Steps in Building the System:
1. User Upload & Image Processing

    User Upload: Users should be able to easily upload a photo on your website. This can be done with a simple file upload button.
    Face Detection: Use an AI-based model to detect and extract the face from the user's uploaded photo. OpenCV combined with deep learning models like MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) or dlib can help with face detection and alignment.
    Face Swap/Transformation: Once the face is detected, the real-time transformation into a Viking face can be done using pre-trained AI models for style transfer or face swapping. The models that can be used here include:
        StyleGAN2 or StyleGAN3: These models can generate realistic face transformations and could be trained or fine-tuned on a Viking dataset.
        DeepFaceLab: For face-swapping, this tool is widely used for high-quality face replacements.
        OpenCV: For aligning the face with the Viking body/scene.
    Background Integration: You can use a background from a selection of pre-designed Viking scenarios (e.g., Viking warrior, shield maiden, etc.). Tools like Photoshop scripting or OpenCV can automate the process of cutting the user's face and integrating it into a new Viking scenario, taking into account lighting, angle, and skin tone adjustments.

Tools:

    Django/Flask (Python-based frameworks) for backend image processing and integration.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch for running pre-trained AI models.

2. Customization of Viking Scenarios

    Users can select a Viking scenario, and the AI system should merge the user’s transformed face into one of the high-resolution background images.
    These backgrounds should be stored in your server, and based on the user’s selection, the system will render the image.

3. Email Automation & Instant Delivery

    Once the Viking face transformation is complete, the final image can be automatically emailed to the user.
    Email Service Integration: Use a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES for sending the final image to users.
    Custom Email Templates: The email should include a branded template (e.g., “Your Viking Transformation Is Ready!”), and include CTAs like product links to encourage purchases.

Tools:

    Flask/Express.js for backend server automation.
    Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing the transformed images before sending them via email.

4. Full Web Integration into Shopify

    You will need to integrate this AI-based face-swapping tool with your Shopify store.
    The Shopify API can be used to trigger the face-swapping process when users upload their photos, and to track users' email and purchase data.
    You can use Shopify's Shopify App integration for adding custom features. You might need to build a custom app to integrate this feature fully.

Integration Workflow:

    Use Shopify's Admin API to handle user data and product catalog.
    Trigger the transformation process from your app once the user uploads the photo.
    After the transformation, you can offer users a chance to view and download their Viking image, share it on social media, or continue shopping.

Tools:

    Shopify App (Node.js/React) for front-end and back-end integration.
    Shopify Webhooks for event handling and interaction with the backend.

5. Scalable Infrastructure for Image Processing

    Since image processing can be intensive, especially with high traffic, use cloud services for scalable processing.
    AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for processing images in real-time without worrying about server scaling.
    Distributed Systems for handling image generation in parallel. If traffic surges, scaling out to multiple servers ensures faster processing.

Tools:

    Docker & Kubernetes for containerizing and scaling the image transformation process.
    Cloud Storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) for storing high-res images.
    Redis or RabbitMQ for queuing image processing tasks, ensuring no traffic delays.

6. Real-Time Image Processing & UI/UX

    The front end of this tool should allow the user to upload their photo, select their Viking scenario, and preview the transformed image.
    Use a React or Vue.js front end to create a smooth, interactive experience.
    Provide a real-time preview of their Viking image as it is being generated (this can be done asynchronously).

UI/UX Considerations:

    Clean design and easy-to-use interface.
    Option for users to share their Viking photo directly on social media after receiving the email.
    Option to download the image immediately after processing.

Example Python Code Snippets for Key Components:

    Face Detection & Alignment (using OpenCV & dlib):

import cv2
import dlib

# Load the pre-trained dlib face detector
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()

def detect_face(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = detector(gray)

    if len(faces) > 0:
        # Return the coordinates of the first detected face
        return faces[0]
    else:
        return None

Face Swapping (using OpenCV and DeepFaceLab):

# Sample code using OpenCV to replace face in a background (simplified approach)
def swap_face(original_face_image, background_image, output_image_path):
    # Read both the images
    original_face = cv2.imread(original_face_image)
    background = cv2.imread(background_image)
    
    # Perform image alignment and blending (simplified)
    resized_face = cv2.resize(original_face, (background.shape[1], background.shape[0]))
    
    # Blending original face with background (this part can be complex and involve more advanced techniques)
    blended = cv2.addWeighted(resized_face, 0.5, background, 0.5, 0)
    
    # Save the resulting image
    cv2.imwrite(output_image_path, blended)

Email Automation (using SendGrid):

    import sendgrid
    from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Email, To, Content

    def send_email(image_path, user_email):
        sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key='SENDGRID_API_KEY')
        from_email = Email("your-email@modernviking.com.au")
        to_email = To(user_email)
        subject = "Your Viking Transformation is Ready!"
        content = Content("text/html", f"Here is your Viking transformation image! <br><img src='cid:viking_img'>")
        
        # Attach the image
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
            attached_file = f.read()

        attachment = Attachment()
        attachment.content = base64.b64encode(attached_file).decode('utf-8')
        attachment.type = "image/jpeg"
        attachment.filename = "viking_transformation.jpg"
        attachment.disposition = "inline"
        attachment.content_id = "viking_img"
        
        mail = Mail(from_email, to_email, subject, content)
        mail.add_attachment(attachment)
        
        response = sg.send(mail)
        return response.status_code

Conclusion:

This system would involve several complex components: face detection, transformation, background integration, and real-time delivery, but with the right AI models, cloud infrastructure, and Shopify integration, it’s entirely possible to automate the Viking face swap process in a scalable, high-quality manner.

If you'd like to proceed with this project, I recommend working with an AI development team skilled in image processing and cloud automation. They can tailor the workflow to meet your specific business needs and expand the feature set as your business grows.
